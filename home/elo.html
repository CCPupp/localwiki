            <ul>
                <li>Player 1 will always win.</li>
                <li>Both players are defaulted to being new to the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This calculator shows how much elo is gained and lost from a match. The nature of the system makes the matches more meaningful if the lesser ranked player beats the higher ranked player. The current system works around the number 75 wherein
                a player can only lose or gain a maximum of 75 points if the match results in a major upset. Closer matches will get a reduced value that is relative to the number 75.</p>
